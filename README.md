# LipaAction — Barangay Web Console

The officials-facing web console for the LipaAction incident-reporting system, as
specified in **Chapter 3, Section 3.7.3** of the LipaAction thesis (Major Revision,
May 2026). Barangay officials use it to review, validate, and reject incident reports
submitted by residents through the LipaAction mobile app, and barangay administrators
use it to verify residents (Tier 1).

The same console also carries a read-only city dashboard for the municipal
administrator (**Section 3.7.5** and **Appendix A.5**): city-wide report activity per
barangay, a map of open reports, a city-wide report list, each agency's response
times, the agency list, and an access log naming the officials who opened and acted on
reports.

This is a working implementation against the project's shared Supabase backend — not
a static mockup. Sign-in is real, report data is real, and validating or rejecting a
report writes to the production database through the same review path the rest of the
system uses.

**Deployed:** <https://lipa-action-web-console.vercel.app> — Vercel, as specified in
Chapter 3. Only pre-provisioned barangay officials and city administrators can sign
in; an unknown email address does not create an account.

## Tech stack

Follows the stack specified in Chapter 3, Section 3.8.3 (Technology Stack) for the
officials' web dashboards. Tailwind CSS was added for styling, since the thesis text
does not specify a CSS framework.

- **Next.js 14** (App Router) + **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Supabase** (Postgres, Auth, Row Level Security) via `@supabase/ssr`

There is no test suite. Verification is `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, and
`npm run build`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
```

Create `.env.local` in the project root with the Supabase project URL and anon key:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

Only the public anon key is used. Every read and write runs as the signed-in official
under Row Level Security; the service-role key is never needed and must not be added.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It redirects to `/login`, and
after sign-in to `/queue`.

### Deploying

The same two variables are the whole configuration — set them on the host for both
production and preview builds. They are read at build time as well as at run time,
because they are `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

One step belongs to Supabase rather than the host: add `https://<your-domain>/auth/callback`
to **Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs**, including the scheme. The
emailed sign-in link is refused otherwise, and Supabase falls back to the project's
Site URL. Don't add a wildcard for a shared hosting domain such as `*.vercel.app`;
that would make any site on that domain a valid destination for sign-in tokens.

`vercel.json` pins the server functions to Singapore (`sin1`), next to the Supabase
project. Without it Vercel runs them in Washington DC, and every database call a page
makes crosses the Pacific twice. If the Supabase project is ever moved, move this too.

## Signing in

Login is passwordless. An official enters their email, receives a one-time code, and
types it back into the same tab. Clicking the link in the email works as a fallback.

Only pre-provisioned accounts can sign in — the login form is configured with
`shouldCreateUser: false`, so an unknown email address does not create an account.
Accounts are created by an administrator in Supabase.

Every page checks the signed-in user's profile role on the server before rendering.
Only `barangay_official`, `barangay_admin`, and `senior_barangay_admin` are admitted;
a `municipal_admin` account is sent to the city dashboard at `/city`, whose pages admit
only that role and send a barangay official back to their queue. Verify Resident admits
only `barangay_admin` and `senior_barangay_admin`, and sends a `barangay_official` back
to the queue. Any other role is
redirected to `/not-authorized`, which offers sign-out so a differently-scoped account
can be used instead. A signed-in user who opens `/login`
is sent to the console. The signed-in official's name, role, and barangay are shown
throughout the interface.

All times are shown in Philippine Standard Time regardless of where the server or the
official's browser is set.

## Pages

| Page | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Queue** | Live. Shows the barangay's pending reports in four tabs — Emergency Fast-triage, Standard intake, Flagged duplicates, Recent validated — with a search box and a detail drawer showing the resident's full account and the classifier's reading of the report. Validate and Reject write to the database; rejection requires one of the thesis's reason categories (wrong category, already resolved, mistaken identity, not an emergency, duplicate, or other) plus an optional note, required for Other. Before a report is validated, its detail drawer shows which agencies routing would send it to. The drawer also shows a small street map, with coordinates, of where the reporter's phone was when they filed, except for a report whose resident withheld their identity or asked for discreet reporting, whose location is never read. A report whose resident asked for discreet handling is marked as such on its row, opens with a do-not-contact banner (Discreet report: do not call or text the reporter), and is flagged again in the routing confirmation. A report whose resident answered that the emergency had already resolved is marked Already resolved, review. A validated report is then routed to the agencies its category maps to, by hand, after a confirmation step; the Recent validated tab separates reports awaiting routing from those already with agencies, lists the latter by when they were routed, newest first, and shows each agency's progress (acknowledged, in progress, resolved, or closed with an outcome) as the agency records it, usually within a second. A report that every agency sends back as out of scope, once the database has returned it to the barangay, can be routed to other agencies the official chooses from a list that leaves out the ones that returned it. Opening a report's details is recorded in the access log, once per opening. On the Flagged duplicates tab, reports are shown in the groups duplicate detection made, each group with its categories and its own action to validate every report in it at once; the largest group also appears as a card on the Emergency tab. When a group mixes categories, the confirmation says so. The page updates live as reports change (a Supabase Realtime subscription, filtered to the barangay and enforced by Row-Level Security), falling back to a 30-second refresh if the live channel cannot connect. A report that arrives on its own is marked as new for a few seconds so it is not missed. The page can also chime when a new emergency arrives, and can raise a browser notification when an emergency has waited more than five minutes. If the data cannot be loaded it says so, rather than showing an empty queue. For a barangay admin or senior barangay admin, the tiles add the flagged-duplicates count, and a recent-activity list below the queue shows the barangay's five newest audit events by role, linking to the Audit Log, with shortcuts to Verify Resident and, for a senior barangay admin, to revoking an attestation, as the thesis's admin home does; its sanctions card waits for the Sanctions page. |
| **Cluster Explorer** | Live. Groups pending reports that the duplicate-detection service has marked as the same incident (a shared `cluster_id`, written back since October 2026). The service compares reports from the same barangay filed within 72 hours of each other, weighing place, time and category, so a group can mix categories. The queue's Flagged duplicates tab shows the same groups, and a group can be validated as one action. The grouping can't be changed from the console. |
| **Validation History** | Live. Reviewed reports (validated or rejected) with the reviewing official, timestamp, rejection category and note, and, for a confirmed report, what became of it since (not routed yet, with agencies, resolved, confirmed false, closed as a duplicate, or returned out of scope). Filters by date range, verdict, official, category, priority and that resolution outcome, over the rows loaded. Exports the visible rows to CSV, and prints or saves them as a PDF through the browser. |
| **Verify Resident** (`/verify-resident`) | Live, for `barangay_admin` and `senior_barangay_admin`. Tier 1 verification (thesis A.3.9): the barangay's attestation, under RA 7160 Section 389(b), that a resident lives there. Lists the barangay's residents by name, with the last four digits of each one's phone number, the day they registered, and their tier, under three groups (not yet verified, verified, all), with a search by name, by a full phone number, or by a number's last four digits. A resident whose profile carries no name is listed, and named in the dialogs, by the ending of their phone number. Verify asks how residency was established (in person, a field visit, or the barangay's own records) and for the official's own statement, neither preselected, and moves the account to Tier 1; the row then shows who attested, how and when. A senior barangay admin can revoke an attestation with a required reason, which returns the account to Tier 0 and stays on the row. Both go through the backend's functions, which enforce the roles and the barangay. |
| **Reports** | Live. Two of the thesis's barangay reports, each exportable as CSV and printable or savable as a PDF through the browser. The Daily Queue Summary (#12): the reports submitted on a chosen day (today by default), by category, counted by where each stands now — awaiting review, validated, or rejected. The Monthly Resolution Time by Agency (#16): for the routings of the barangay's reports that agencies closed in a chosen month, each agency's median time from routing to resolution (with the 95th percentile once it has 20 timings), with reports returned out of scope counted apart. The rest of the thesis's barangay catalogue is listed with the reason each isn't generated: the weekly false-report rate per reporter (#14) and the monthly resident engagement summary (#17) need reporters' identities, which the console never reads; weekly verification activity (#13), which counts the verifications made on the Verify Resident page, is not built yet; the weekly safety-net trigger summary (#15) needs events nothing records; and monthly recall usage (#18) has nothing to count while automatic routing is off. |
| **Settings** | Profile is live (name, role, barangay, email, phone); the display name is editable. Language and alert preferences are saved in the browser on the current device. The interface language switches the console between English and Tagalog — the same choice as the EN/TL switch at the top right of every page; the alert preferences drive the Queue page's chime and browser notification. Senior barangay administrators default to Tagalog, as the thesis specifies. The bilingual-emphasis setting is recorded but does not yet change any screen, and says so. |
| **City overview** (`/city`) | Live, read-only, for the municipal administrator. City-wide tiles (reports today, the 7-day daily average, reports awaiting review, Critical ones among them, and emergencies waiting more than five minutes), then one row per barangay: its last 7 days as daily bars, today's count, what awaits review now however old, and how many of the week's reports were validated or rejected. No decision or routing controls. Prints or saves as a PDF through the browser. |
| **City map** (`/city/map`) | Live, read-only. Reports still open (awaiting review, validated, or with agencies) from the last 7 days, as dots on an OpenStreetMap street map coloured by priority, each where the reporter's phone was when they filed. A report whose resident withheld their identity or asked for discreet reporting is never placed on the map: it is counted under its barangay beside the map, as are reports sent without a location. Every dot is also listed in a table below the map. Counts by priority sit above the map and cover every open report, the ones kept off it included, and the dots and the table can be narrowed by priority and category. A dot, or Details in the table, opens the report in the city report list, whose drawer records the opening in the access log. |
| **City reports** (`/city/reports`) | Live, read-only. Every report filed in the city in the last 30 days, newest first, filterable by barangay and by stage (awaiting review, validated but not routed, with agencies, rejected). Each row shows its time, barangay, category, priority with score, status, and the agencies holding it with the lead agency's progress. The list shows no description; the detail drawer shows the resident's account, the triage reading and each agency's progress, has no decision or routing controls, and records every opening in the access log, as the queue's drawer does. A report can also be opened straight from the city map. |
| **Agency response** (`/city/response-times`) | Live, read-only. The thesis's per-agency response time view: for every routing in the last 30 days, per agency, how many reports it was sent, how many await acknowledgement, how many it is working on now, the median time to acknowledge and from acknowledgement to resolution (with the 95th percentile once an agency has 20 timings), and how many it resolved or returned out of scope. Below the table, the same two clocks per agency and report category, as two grids. Exports CSV and prints or saves a PDF through the browser. |
| **Agencies** (`/city/agencies`) | Live, read-only. Every agency configured in the system, with its code and tier, and the report categories routing sends to it, lead categories marked. Adding agencies or changing where a category goes is not done here. |
| **Access log** (`/city/access-log`) | Live, read-only, for the municipal administrator. Every recorded event on reports across the city (openings, decisions, routings and agency progress), newest first, with the official who acted named alongside their role and office, filterable by kind of event. Residents are never named, an event the database wrote by itself is shown as automatic, and no raw account identifier appears. Opening the page is itself recorded, and if that record can't be written the page shows nothing. |
| **City settings** (`/city/settings`) | Live. The city account's own display name, which the access log shows beside what it opened, with its email read-only, and the console's language, kept in the browser as on the barangay side. No alert switches: those drive the barangay queue. |
| **Audit Log** | Live. The barangay's own access trail: every report opening, validation, rejection and routing on its reports, newest first, filterable by kind and by date (today, the last 7 days). Read access comes through a database function that returns only the safe columns, not a table policy, so no official is named and the reporter is never in it — each row shows the time, the action, the role that did it, and the report. It loads the newest 500 events and says so. |

All report data on the barangay pages is scoped to the signed-in official's own
barangay by Row Level Security in the database. The application does not, and cannot,
widen that scope. The city dashboard reads city-wide, as its role is permitted to.

## Privacy

Officials never see a reporter's name, whether or not the resident chose to withhold
their identity. The interface shows only "Verified reporter" or "Verified reporter,
identity withheld", the thesis's wording.
This is deliberate — the system exposes no reporter-name field to officials at all —
and it applies to every page, the CSV export included.

Access is logged as well as restricted. Opening a report's detail drawer calls the
backend's `log_report_view` function, which records the official, the report, and the
resident whose data was viewed. The console never supplies the resident's identity to
that call; the backend resolves it from the report. Validations, rejections and routings
are logged through the backend functions that perform them. If a view can't be logged,
the console says so on screen rather than failing silently.

The city dashboard follows the same rule. Its role can read reporter identity in the
database, so the dashboard's queries never select the reporter's account, and no page
names a reporter. Its counts carry no personal data, so viewing them writes no access
record; opening a report in the city report list is logged like any other opening.
The one page that names officials is the city access log, the oversight view of the
trail: it shows who opened, decided and routed each report, never whom a report
concerns, and never a resident. Opening it is recorded too, and it shows nothing if that
record can't be written. The city map and the barangay report drawer are the
only places that read a report's location, and only for reports whose resident neither
withheld their identity nor asked for discreet reporting; for those, the location is never
read at all, and on the city map the report is only counted under its barangay.

Verify Resident is the one barangay page that names residents, because an official
cannot attest that a person lives in the barangay without knowing who the person is. It
is open to the two administrator roles only, and it reads a resident's name, the last
four digits of their phone number (the full number never reaches the browser), their
registration date and their attestations. It reads nothing a resident reported, so no
report can be tied to a name through it. A search is sent in the body of a request and
never as part of the page's address, so a resident's name or number is not left in the
browser's history or in the web host's request log. The database's own API log does
record the query a search becomes, and the backend team can read that log. What is
recorded for an attestation is who attested, how and when; no ID number, ID image or
biometric is stored anywhere. The page does put each resident's account id in the
admin's browser beside the name, because the write needs it; the queue's live updates
carry the same id on each report (see Known limitations), so the two could be joined
outside the screen until the backend change already asked for is made.

What the log does not cover yet: the queue list itself shows each report's category and
the opening line of its description before any view is logged, the Validation History
CSV export writes no audit record, and viewing the city map writes none either, though
each dot is where a resident was when they reported. Opening the Verify Resident list
writes no access record either; each attestation and revocation is recorded by the
backend function that performs it. All four are recorded as open questions for the
backend and data-protection review.

One limit is structural: the console records an opening, but the database does not
require one. An official's own session can read the same reports through the database's
API, which row-level security allows and nothing logs. A complete trail needs the backend
to serve report details only through a function that records the read as it returns it.

and is marked `server-only`.

## Known limitations

These are gaps in the data available to the console, not unfinished interface work.
In each case the console shows nothing rather than an approximation.

- **The Audit Log shows roles, not officials, and the newest 500 events.** The read
  function deliberately withholds who acted and whom the report concerned, so the page
  cannot name an official; its filters narrow the events already loaded rather than the
  whole trail, and the page says so.
- **Access-log coverage is incomplete.** See the Privacy section: list rows and the CSV
  export are not individually logged, live updates deliver full report rows to the
  browser because Supabase cannot filter that feed by column, and a read made outside
  the console, directly through the database's API, is not logged at all.
- **Only the city access log names who opened a report.** The barangay Audit Log's
  read function returns no actor identity, so a desk sees that a report was opened by a
  role, never by whom; the municipal administrator's access log names the official.
  There is no who-viewed-this panel on a report itself.
- **The city access log shows the newest 200 events of the chosen kind.** Names and
  offices are read from each official's profile as it is now; the role shown is the one
  recorded with the event. The thesis's CSV export of the log for data-protection requests
  is not built: an export is itself an access event and would need its own record.
- **Verify Resident lists residents, not requests.** The thesis's page is a queue of
  residents who asked for Tier 1 verification, each confirmed by scanning a QR code
  from the resident's phone. No request is recorded anywhere, so the page lists the
  barangay's residents by tier, with a search by name or phone number (the first 100
  by name), and the official finds the person in front of them. A profile can carry no
  name, and such a resident is found by their number. There is no QR step and no photo
  cross-check. A revoked resident can be verified again; the earlier revocation and its
  reason stay on the row.
- **Cluster data.** The console shows which reports the duplicate-detection service
  grouped, not why: no centroid, radius, or per-report proximity signal is shown, and
  the spatial panel is a labelled schematic rather than a map with invented positions.
  Only reports from the same barangay filed within 72 hours of each other are compared,
  and only pending reports are grouped, so a group thins out as its members are decided.
  Reports sent without a location, every identity-withheld report included, are left out
  of grouping. Grouping by photo similarity is not computed.
- **Priority comes from the inference service.** A report it has not scored is labelled
  Not scored rather than given a tier, and pending reports are listed highest score
  first, then longest-waiting first, with unscored reports after scored ones. Because
  the model rates nearly every emergency Critical, each row shows its score beside the
  tier; the ranking is carried by the score, not by the colour.
- **Routing is manual and one-way.** Nothing routes a validated report automatically;
  an official routes it, and the agencies are chosen by the category-to-agency mapping,
  not by the official. A category with no mapping is reported as needing barangay
  review rather than sent anywhere. Routing cannot be undone from the console. The one
  place an official chooses the agencies is a report that every agency closed as out of
  scope: the database returns it to the barangay as validated, and the official picks
  other agencies for it from a list that leaves out the ones that sent it back. The
  backend has an automatic routing for high-confidence emergencies, switched off until
  the thesis's recall window exists, which is not implemented either; if it is ever
  switched on, a report it routes appears under Routed to agencies marked Auto-routed,
  and one that every agency sends back returns to the Emergency tab, marked as returned
  by the agencies, for a review before another agency is chosen.
- **Rejection categories are stored inside the reason text.** The database has one
  free-text reason per decision and no category column, so the category is saved as a
  short prefix (for example `[duplicate]`) that the console reads back. Rejections made
  before categories existed, or by another dashboard sharing the database, appear
  without a category.
- **Manual report intake** is not offered. Reports are attributable to a resident
  account by design, so intake on a walk-in resident's behalf requires a decision on
  attribution before it can be built.
- **Cluster splitting and merging** are not offered. Barangay roles cannot write
  cluster assignments, and a manual split would be undone by the next detection pass.
- **Report addresses.** Reports carry a geographic point, not an address string, so the
  drawer shows the point on a street map with its coordinates, not a street address. The
  map's tiles come from OpenStreetMap's public tile server, which therefore sees the area
  of each report opened.
- **Validation History** shows the 50 most recent reviewed reports. Filters apply to
  those rows.
- **Reports export CSV and print to PDF, not PNG.** The thesis also describes a PNG export
  of the Daily Queue Summary, which is not built; the browser's print dialog saves a PDF.
- **Preferences are per device.** Language and alert settings live in the browser, not
  in the account, because no profile column exists for them and browser-notification
  permission is granted per browser anyway. Alerts fire only while the Queue page is
  open; there is no push to a closed console.
- **The Tagalog interface covers the console's own text, not everything on screen.**
  Menus, buttons, tabs, dialogs, notices, and empty states switch language. Report
  text is never translated — it is shown exactly as the resident wrote it. Values the
  server formats (report categories, priority levels, relative times like "5m ago",
  review timestamps) and error messages returned by the server stay in English, as do
  the sign-in and error pages and the CSV export. The Tagalog wording was reviewed by the
  team on 2026-09-29. A page loads in the role's default
  language and switches to a different saved choice a moment later.
- **The alert sound needs one click on the queue page.** Browsers block sound on a page
  nobody has clicked, and the chime is triggered by an arriving report, not a click. After
  loading or refreshing the queue, the footer asks for one click until it has had one.
  Settings has a test-sound button.
- **The city dashboard covers three of the thesis's six city views.** The city-wide
  overview, the incident map and per-agency response time are built, plus a city-wide
  report list, a read-only agency list and an access log. Not built: the false-route rate (defined over automatically routed reports; automatic routing is
  off), cross-barangay verification quality,
  recalibration controls, agency management (adding, elevating or editing agencies), identity reveal, and
  multi-factor sign-in.
  Response times are measured from when a barangay routed the report, since nothing
  routes automatically.
- **Live updates need a websocket.** On a network that blocks them, the queue says so
  in its footer and falls back to a 30-second refresh.
- **The city map is a snapshot of phone positions.** It loads when opened and doesn't
  update live, unlike the queue. Each dot is where the reporter's phone was, which may not
  be where the incident is. The street map comes from OpenStreetMap's public tile
  server, which therefore sees which part of the city is being viewed.

## Notes on fidelity to the thesis mockups

- Colors, badges, and layout are derived from Figures 23, 24, 48, 49, and 50 and their
  accompanying descriptions in Chapter 3 and Appendix A.
- Bilingual EN/Tagalog microcopy (e.g. "Mga aksyon · pag-verify, pag-recall, at
  pag-merge") is reproduced where the thesis text specifies it.
- The "Recall window" queue tab from the mockups was dropped; the backend has no
  corresponding concept.
- Where a mockup element had no backing data (trust-score deltas, median resolution
  time, MFA status), it was either removed or relabelled to what is actually measured.
  The queue's "Median wait" tile, for example, is the median age of pending reports.
