/**
 * The route-to-agency flow, shared by the queue row and the detail drawer,
 * for the same reason useReportReview is shared: two entry points must not
 * drift on the confirmation step or on how a partial run is reported.
 *
 * No local [routed] mark is kept. routeReport revalidates /queue, so the
 * report comes back with its new status and agency rows in the same
 * response — the server's answer is the only one shown.
 *
 * isConfirming opens whichever step the report's routing state calls for:
 * the plain confirmation for a first or unfinished routing, the agency
 * picker for a report every agency sent back.
