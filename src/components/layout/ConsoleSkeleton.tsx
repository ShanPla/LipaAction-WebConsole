/**
 * Placeholder chrome shown while a gated page's server work is in flight.
 *
 * Every console route is force-dynamic and does two sequential awaits — the
 * auth gate, then the data query — before it can render anything. Without a
 * loading state the click registers and the screen simply sits there, which
 * reads as a broken link rather than as work in progress.
 *
 * It mirrors AppShell's geometry (w-60 sidebar, bordered top bar) so the real
 * page settles into the same layout instead of jumping. It cannot render
 * AppShell itself: AppShell needs an OfficialProfile, and at this point the
 * auth gate that produces one hasn't run yet.
