 * What an official sees when a console page throws.
 *
 * Deliberately does not print error.message. These pages talk to Supabase, so
 * a raw message can carry table names, column names, or policy details — of no
 * use to a barangay secretary and not worth putting on screen. The digest is
 * shown instead: it's the handle that ties this screen to the server log.
 *
 * Note this only catches unexpected throws. A failed data query does NOT land
 * here — src/lib/data/* fails closed and returns an empty result, so a broken
 * query renders as an empty page rather than an error.
