 * chosen Manila month, the median and 95th-percentile time from the routing
 * to the resolution, per agency.
 *
 * agency_routing has no barangay column. ar_select_barangay, the policy that
 * lets the queue show agency progress, returns only rows of the official's
 * own barangay's reports, and that is the scope here, as in the queue's
 * Routed to agencies list.
 *
 * Out-of-scope closures are counted apart and kept out of the timing, as on
 * the city's Agency response page: sending a report back is not fixing it.
 * Only agency and time columns are read; nothing names a person.
