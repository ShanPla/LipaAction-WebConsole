 *  - routing rows fail → routed reports show their status without agency
 *    progress; a half-finished routing can't be detected, which is safe
 *    because routeReport is idempotent.
 *  - the category mapping fails → routingPlan stays null on validated
 *    reports, which the UI shows as [couldn't load routing options] rather
 *    than as [no agency mapped], a claim it couldn't back up.
 *  - agency names fail → [Unnamed agency], and a returned report gets no
 *    list of other agencies to choose from (routingOptions null), which the
 *    UI shows as [couldn't load the agency list] rather than as [no other
 *    agency].
 *
 * Pending reports get the category mapping too, for the drawer's preview of
 * where a report would go once validated (the paper's [you're confirming,
 * not choosing], p.186). A preview sends nothing: routing is still its own
 * confirmed step after validation.
 *
 * Pending reports get their agency rows as well, for one case: a report
 * routed automatically, before any review, that every agency then sent back
 * as out of scope. The backend's handback returns it to 'prioritized', into
 * the pending queue, and its rows are what show it was returned — without
 * them the drawer would offer the very agencies that returned it as where
 * routing will send it. Every other pending report has no rows.
